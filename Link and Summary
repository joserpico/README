in this project analysis of used cars from a used car website, I used streamlit, plotly.express and panda libraries to find out the best prices for the overall conditions of cars that are listed on the site. The two conditions I check against the price of the car is the overall condition [i.e. "good" , "like new" , "fair", etc.] and the mileage on the car, as these are the two things users tend to look at the most when buying a used car. to simulate the random event of a customer wanting to find out the price of a car via its condition. The randomness of the event [the event being which condition of car the customer would like to see]
is satisified by the check boxes at the top of the application, which will adjust the data shown on the stackbar chart beneath it (the check boxes are click to exclude). Under the stackbar chart is a scatterplot that shows the price of a car based on how much mileage the car has on it.
to run this application on your local machine, you would need to install the enviroment of streamlit, pandas and plotly.express and download the file app.py and input "streamline run app.py" into your command prompt.
